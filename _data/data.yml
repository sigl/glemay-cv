  summary: |
    Since my earlier age, i've always deal with computer at the beginning of 2000 years,
    self-taugh, with perseverence everytime something new to learn. I've learn the meaning of DDoS 
    on IRC for the first time and still learning every day. 
    |
    I've keep repairing computer until i got tired of the doing the same thing and wanted to see something more basic, so mecanic 
    was the next step, this is were the management training began, having to handle, 10 heads, 30 daily customer with each different tasks or request 
    without forgetting something. 
    |
    During my last years in mecanic, technology came back in my mind, and discovered that i've should'nt have left! I've learn in the past 7-10 years, technology 
    will bring something that we don't see right now but i want be there to make it happen!
