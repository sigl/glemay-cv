  summary: |
    Since my earlier age, i've always deal with computer at the beginning of 2000 years,
    self-taugh, with perseverence everytime something new to learn. I've learn the meaning of DDoS 
    on IRC for the first time and still learning every day. 
    
    I've keep repairing computer until i got tired of the doing the same thing and wanted to see something more basic, so mecanic 
    was the next step, this is where the management training began, having to handle, 10 heads, 30 daily customer with each different tasks or request 
    without forgetting something. 
    
    During my last years in mecanic, technology came back in my mind, and discovered that i've should'nt have left! I've learn in the past 7-10 years, technology 
    will bring something that we don't see right now but i want be there to make it happen!

      During my time as technical advisor, i had to manage the 10 mecanic jobs, sell and schedule repair. Also had to investigate any vehicule sent for inspection as mecanical inspection or rebuild vehicule.
      
      Each rebuild inspection require a lot of paper work and come with it lot of fake invoice, fake estimate or stolen vehicule from other country. I've became a specialist to find out counterfeid docs. In the mean time,
      we built a building expension to accomodate 3 new repair door which was really challenging while maintaining the constant repair/customer flow. Also got the chance to learn almost everything about car, from replacing parts to rebuild a full engine from stratch.
